Not just the usual ""procedural programming in an OO language"", but the real stuff. Focus on messages not objects, keep things small and focused, how to achieve loose coupling, all the good stuff. It doesn't slam you with acronyms and jargon, it explains the most fundamental principles in clear terms & with concrete examples.<br/><br/>The only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is because I have some issues with the last chapter regarding testing. I mostly work in statically typed languages and some of the really important messages in that chapter get muddled with some extra tests that are only required in dynamic languages due to their lack of interfaces as first-class concept. The real important stuff of that chapter is one of the few and concrete explanations of testing in isolation & contract testing as popularized by <a href=""http://blog.thecodewhisperer.com/permalink/clearing-up-the-integrated-tests-scam"">J.B. Rainsberger</a>.
