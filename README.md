# fsharp-type-providers
Accompanying code for my blog post on F# type providers

## Prerequisites
* [F#](http://fsharp.org/use/windows/) with the fsi.exe REPL.
* An editor with F# support. [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/) works fine, but you can also use [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Ionide](http://ionide.io/) plugin.

## Running the examples
* Run *.\paket\pakket.bootstrapper.exe* to install the [Paket](https://fsprojects.github.io/Paket/) dependency manager.
* Run *.\paket\paket.exe install* to install all the required dependencies.
* Run fsi.exe with one of the .fsx files as argument to run a script in its entirety.Alternatively, if you want an interactive experience: open the .fsx files in an editor of your choice.
